Why is "What is XX" on the 9th not matching the relevant rule?
New rules have top priority
Editing a project via the event tooltip doesn't work (dialog does work)
Indicate whether a relevant rule already exists
Organizer rule should be using a contact id
  Contacts should be managed like projects at the top level
  And refreshed after a sync as they're created on demand
When I create a rule I lose my place in the log
At calendar sync time can we filter out cancelled events? They seem to have titles prefixed with "Canceled:" but perhaps there's a better way in EventKit.
Ensure links open in external browser always (tooltip -> a google doc opened inside)
Add user defined "note" log entries
Start storing time against projects on a daily basis - independent from events and their aggregations but informed by them from a user perspective.
Access via the log entry for a day
Add an entry for a week and a month too with aggregations
Move Settings to the bottom of the sidebar.
Fix the crappy looking calendar control in the log view
Fix the handling of dates with no content
Remove useIsMobile and uses

And... that's all folks?
