Ensure rules are logical
Add date ranges to rules (to support the primary focus on a repo changing project over time)

Start storing time against projects on a daily basis - independent from events and their aggregations but informed by them from a user perspective.
Access via the log entry for a day
Add an entry for a week and a month too with aggregations
Move Settings to the bottom of the sidebar.
